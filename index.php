 * OK, Alfred, let's get the following done:
 *  1. this first excavation will be called batcave 0.1.  This will not be the main home site for long as it's below minimum viable release, but I  want to keep it for historical value.  It will eventually be version0-1.buildingthebatcave.com and I want all the links to reflect this; we should be able (within update limits) to see the site in previous versions
 *  2. Global stylesheet of course
 *  3. version of the site in upper right corner
 *  4. that's about it.
